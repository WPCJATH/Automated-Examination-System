-Automated-Examination-System
The project is an online exam system inspired by the online teaching caused by the coronavirus.
Teachers publish, edit and grade tests on the system, and can query students' transcripts after the tests.
Students work on the system or check their grades.

The initial data for the database is generated using Python and contains:
16 teachers 30*5 students 8 subjects 5 classes

This system and GUI is generated by JAVA14, MySQL used for adding, deleting, modifying and quering data.
Details are in Project description and report.

Thanks for coming!
